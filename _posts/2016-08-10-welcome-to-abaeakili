Hey there..
I am Abae Akili..
Welcome to my site.

Hmm...where do we start.. do you think I can pitch you?
Lets not start to be boring..as usual, lets be smart, in a good way..
Trust me.. You will find it fun..

*Abae* is a *Website & Mobile Application developer*. *Business Management* & *Computer Science student*. An *Entrepreneur, Environmentalist* & above all, I love travelling. I live in the Coastal City of *Mombasa, Kenya*. I love Creating Stuff, playing with Electronics & reading Blogs. I enjoy spending time with my Friends and Family, & when I am not with them, then I am Sharing Knowledge... or learning a new thing with the Tech Community here.

I do and support community work, support non-profit organisations and I accept challanges. Hit me up for volunteer work. ðŸ˜Š
